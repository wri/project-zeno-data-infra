    | **Title** | Global grassland class and extent |
    | **Description** <br> A descriptive summary of what the dataset is and key details, such as information on geographic coverage, temporal range, and the data sources used. | Annual 30 m maps of global grassland class and extent from 2000 to 2024. The dataset showing the spatiotemporal distribution of cultivated and natural/semi-natural grassland classes.<br><br>This dataset defines ‘grasslands’ very broadly such that they encompass grasslands, shrublands, and savannas by including any land cover type which contains at least 30% of dry or wet low vegetation, dominated by grasses and forbs (less than 3 meters) and a:<br>maximum of 50% tree canopy cover (greater than 5 meters),<br>maximum of 70% of other woody vegetation (scrubs and open shrubland), and<br>maximum of 50% active cropland cover in mosaic landscapes of cropland & other vegetation.<br><br>Natural/semi-natural grassland: Relatively undisturbed native grasslands/short-height vegetation, such as steppes and tundra, as well as areas that have experienced varying degrees of human activity in the past, which may contain a mix of native and introduced species due to historical land use and natural processes. In general, they exhibit natural-looking patterns of varied vegetation and clearly ordered hydrological relationships throughout the landscape.  |
    | **Function / usage notes in Zeno** <br> The intended use of the dataset. How might users employ this data in order to have some impact in the world?<br>When should Zeno suggest/use this dataset? Please include examples of use cases (e.g. X dataset can be used for XYZ). You can also include these examples in the prompt spreadsheet. | This global grasslands dataset is intended to be used for monitoring natural/semi-natural grasslands in individual years as well as change over time.<br>This dataset should be used when a user asks about area in a specific year or gain or loss of area between years for natural/semi-natural grasslands. This dataset may be NOT be overlaid with DIST alert data to find alerts in natural/semi-natural grasslands. It can be used to find where natural/semi-natural grasslands were in 2020 and then see how they have changes since then.<br>Any questions about snapshot or baseline natural/semi-natural in a given year, any questions about change over time in natural/semi-natural grasslands in a single time step or trends over the full time period. Any questions about spatial patterns of change in a given geography, any questions about hotspots and outlier detection. Any questions about the accuracy of the data (validation) or the cross-dataset consistence with ESA World Cover, UMD LC, etc.<br>This data should not be used for questions about cultivated grasslands, croplands, or open shrublands. We suggest guiding the LLM to use Global Pasture Watch data for any prompts specific to natural and semi-natural grasslands and to use the harmonized UMD LC data for any questions regarding cultivated, improved, or planted pasture, short vegetation, and croplands. |
    | **Methodology** <br> How was this dataset created? | The dataset showing the spatiotemporal distribution of cultivated and natural/semi-natural grassland classes. was produced by using GLAD Landsat ARD-2 image archive, accompanied by climatic, landform and proximity covariates, spatiotemporal machine learning (per- class Random Forest) and over 2.3 M reference samples (visually interpreted in Very High Resolution imagery). Custom probability thresholds (based on five-fold spatial cross-validation) were used to derive dominant class maps with balanced user’s and producer’s accuracy, resulting in f1 score of 0.64 and 0.75 for cultivated and natural/semi-natural grassland, respectively. |
    | **Cautions in Zeno**<br>What should be kept in mind when using this dataset?<br>When should Zeno not suggest/use this dataset? Feel free to include examples of when the data should not be used (e.g. X dataset cannot be used for XYZ).<br>Generates a persistent resource link for deforestation alerts analytics requests. | Despite the flexibility provided by the probability maps, we note several classification issues and limitation in our grassland predictions (see Table 6). Most of these issues (e.g. specially the miss-classification errors) are not trivial to resolve in the face of Random Forest as a complex and non-linear prediction system, as we are not sure these outcomes happen because of (1) extrapolation problems, (2) noise/limited detectability in the Landsat images, (3) fuzzy definition of grassland classes, (4) need of more specialized and regional/local ML models, or (5) simply a lack of training points in these areas.<br>It appears that intensively managed grasslands, with high homogeneity under many conditions, have a high chance of being confused with other classes that have very similar spectral properties, such as urban mosaics (i.e. buildings, sparse trees and grass fields with different densities) or (greenish) croplands with similar vegetation height and spatial configuration (such as cereal crops). Less intensively cultivated grasslands, where more diverse plant species can be found and where the landscape may not be very regular, are easily confused with grasslands that are not cultivated or (semi) natural herbaceous vegetation, in general. In addition, the spectral signal of cultivated grasslands can not be as clearly distinguished from natural/semi-natural grassland as it could be from croplands, where there are clear breaks in vegetation growth in cases where multi-temporal clear-sky images are available.<br>The distinction between cultivated and natural/semi-natural grasslands has been notoriously difficult to map in the past, which has also affected our reference data collection and harmonization process. Hence, our reference labeling protocol relied on more indirect indicators of management, such as fences and other typi- cal infrastructure, hay bales, machine presence, and even animal presence in the field or geometric shapes of the landscape. This may lead to an underestimation of signs of cultivation that may be less intensive or where VHR imagery was not available at the time of management practices.<br>**Under-estimation of grassland extent**<br>Grassland extent is under-predicted in southeastern Africa (mainly in Zimbabwe and Mozambique) and in eastern Australia (mainly in the shrublands and woodlands of the Mulga ecoregion).<br>**Cropland misclassified as grassland**<br>In the state of Montana, USA, cropland areas located on historical prairie areas have high probability values for natural/semi-natural grassland and low values for cultivated grassland,<br>In arid and hyperarid landscapes of northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula herbaceous croplands areas (irrigated pivot agriculture) presented high probability values for cultivated grasslands,<br>Sudan, Niger, Uganda, Kenya, and Mali have several cropland areas with high probability values for natural/semi-natural grassland,<br>In the state of Western Australia, New Zealand, the center of Bolivia, and the state of Mato Grosso (Brazil), large cropland areas have high probability values of cultivated grasslands.<br>**Mixed farmland mosaics misclassified as grassland**<br>Farmland mosaics in North-Eastern Uganda’s present high probability for both grassland classes,<br>In eastern Madagascar extensive areas of shifting agriculture have high values for cultivated grassland probabilities<br>**Woody vegetation lost misclassified as grassland**<br>In arid and hyperarid landscapes of northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula mixed crop-livestock systems and tree crops presented high probability values for cultivated grasslands,<br>Western African Sahel belt, the Northern-Central African and the savanna-desert transition zone (Eastern Chad/Western Sudan) have high values of cultivated grassland probabilities in intensively grazed areas with partially lost woody vegetation,<br>Non-cultivated (low-input) pastures/herbaceous cover in recently deforested areas in Selva Maya (Chiapas, Petén) and the Arc of Deforestation in Amazon Region presented high probability values for cultivated grasslands.<br>**Macroscopic errors**<br>Although important for grassland separation, the 1-km accessibility maps and MODIS products (MOD11A2 and MCD19A2) introduced curvilinear macroscopic errors (due to the downscaling strategy based on cubicspline) in Uruguay, Southwest Argentina, South of Angola and in Sahel region in Africa.<br>Due to the Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector failure, regular stripes of grassland probabilities are visible at parcel-level. This issue is more prominent in 2012, where GLAD Landsat ARD-2 relies only in Landsat 7 imagery.<br><br>Spectral overlap between natural and cultivated grasslands (especially fallow fields or lightly grazed areas) can result in misclassification.<br>Regional differences in management practices may not be detectable in global models.<br>Data likely reflects a snapshot per year, not intra-annual dynamics or land use rotations (e.g. grazing/fallow cycles).<br>Definitions of "natural", "semi-natural", and "cultivated" vary by region and culture; users should not assume the dataset reflects legal or ecological classifications in every context.<br>Short-term disturbances (fire, grazing, flood) might be:<br>1. Misclassified as change<br>2. Undetected if recovery is rapid<br>3. Dataset may not represent functional health of grasslands (e.g. degradation, productivity loss).<br>It’s important to understand that while natural / semi-natural grassland areas can and do support grazing by wild ruminants and domestic livestock, these areas can still retain significant ecological value. These ecosystems continue to provide carbon storage, biodiversity habitat, and ecosystem services such as water regulation, pollination, and soil stabilization. However, once converted to cropland or pasture (through intensive management actions such as plowing or planting), or built areas (e.g. cities or energy infrastructure), or are seriously degraded (e.g. become bare ground) many of those benefits are lost or severely diminished.<br>Very long crop rotations or shifting cultivation systems may be captured in our analysis as loss events. While these land use changes may be temporary or part of cyclical agricultural practices, they can resemble permanent conversion in satellite-based land cover datasets, particularly when vegetation structure changes significantly or persists across multiple years.<br>Many forms of degradation, such as declines in plant diversity, aboveground productivity, soil health, or subtle structural changes, may not result in a detectable land cover change and are therefore not reflected as Natural / semi-natural grassland loss.<br>Not all gross gains detected in Natural / semi-natural grassland areas reflect deliberate or ecologically desirable restoration. Some observed transitions may result from land abandonment rather than active restoration, and in some cases regrowth may be dominated by invasive species or woody plant encroachment. Further, long fallow periods within rotational or shifting agricultural systems may be misclassified as gains when in fact they are part of a temporary cycle.  Some gains may reflect early successful stages or temporary states rather than mature, functioning, and recovered ecosystems.<br>Area estimates for this analysis were derived using pixel counting, which involves summing the number of 30-m pixels classified as natural/semi-natural grasslands and converting this count to an area estimate. However, pixel counting is not best practice for area estimation., as it does not account for classification uncertainties or biases. |
